this program is created to have understanding of class and constructor.

Class:
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

Object:
An object that is created using a class is said to be an instance of that class. We will sometimes say that the object belongs to the class. The variables that the object contains are called instance variables. The methods (that is, subroutines) that the object contains are called instance methods.

This Keyword:
attribute and parameters of method can contain same name. So to access attribute we can use this keyword.


Constructor:
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:

In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called. It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
